summary: The navbar creates a Bootstrap `nav` element and applies Sky UX classes to it.
---

The navbar directive creates a Bootstrap `nav` element with the appropriate Sky UX classes applied to it and its children, and also adds behavior such as showing sub-navigation items when the user hovers over the dropdown. If you do not wish to use the omnibar for collapsing the navbar into a mobile menu on small screens, then place the `bb-navbar-showmobile` class on the `bb-navbar` directive.
